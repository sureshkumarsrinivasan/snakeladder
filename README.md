The Snake and Ladder game in Java is a simple board game where players roll a dice to reach position 100. The board has snakes that pull players down and ladders that boost them up. Players take turns, advancing based on dice rolls. The first player to land exactly on 100 wins. It demonstrates randomization, conditionals, and loops in programming.
